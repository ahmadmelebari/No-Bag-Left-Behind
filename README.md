Introduction:

Unattended luggage in public spaces, such as airports and
train stations, poses significant security risks. It is a major
security concern due to its potential to harbor dangerous
materials, and its presence often leads to evacuations and
service disruptions. Unattended luggage, if left unchecked,
can trigger public panic and economic losses for nearby
businesses.
